# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project implements a Collaborative Filtering-Based Movie Recommendation System using Matrix Factorization via the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm.
Dataset link for cosine similarities : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata/data
for Matrix factorization : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset?resource=download

Dataset should be stored in folder "data"
